# Transition Guides for JANA1 to JANA2

Welcome to the transition guides for JANA1 to JANA2! This page provides an overview of the changes and directs you to detailed documentation to help you navigate the updates effectively.

## Overview

As JANA transitions from version 1 (JANA1) to version 2 (JANA2), several important changes have been made. To assist you in adapting to these changes, we have created two comprehensive guides:

1. **Developers Transition Guide:** This guide focuses on key syntax and structural changes between JANA1 and JANA2. It is intended for developers who need to understand and update their codebase according to the new standards.
   - [Developers Transition Guide: Key Syntax Changes](#developers-transition-guide)

2. **Parameter Changes Guide:** This guide details the changes in parameters between JANA1 and JANA2. It provides user-focused information on how these changes impact configurations and usage.
   - [Parameter Changes](parameter-changes-guide.md)


These resources are designed to help you understand the modifications and adapt your workflow accordingly. For additional assistance or if you have any questions, contact [rasool@jlab.org](mailto:rasool@jlab.org).
